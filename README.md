# Audio_Normalizer
This script will run through all files and change the dbFs (loudness) to the target.
Anything louder that -5dbFs and there will most likely be distortion. 
Most audio is below -10 (-15 to -10 is where most audio on YouTube lies). 

NOTE: ffmpeg must have to be manually installed (Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIMVp4jWXo). 
May be updated in the future for auto installation or self contained usage
